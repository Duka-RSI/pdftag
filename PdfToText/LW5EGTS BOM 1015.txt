Going through above process, there will have 1/2" needle hole leave on surface but needle hole marks will be covered by pocket opening.

Due to fabric is thick, suggest single needle chainstitch instead overlock at waistband vertical side seam, so seam allowance can be split to either side. 2. Because there is 4mm space between elastic and top of waistband edge, we recommend bottom coverstitch 1/4" instead of 1/8" at inside waistband, in order to ensure stitch can hold elastic. 3.
